    <!-- 
        There are two elements commonly used for marking up quotations.

        <blockquote>
                element used for longer quotes that take up an
                entire paragraph. Note how the <p> element is still
                used inside the <blockquote> element.
 
    -->
    <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh">
        <p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start again?</p>
    </blockquote>


    <!--
        <q>
            elemnt used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.

            I can also use the cite attribute for the <q> element to indicate
            where the quote is from.
    -->
    <p>
        As A.A Milne said. <q>Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though.
        That's the problem.
        </q>
    </p>
